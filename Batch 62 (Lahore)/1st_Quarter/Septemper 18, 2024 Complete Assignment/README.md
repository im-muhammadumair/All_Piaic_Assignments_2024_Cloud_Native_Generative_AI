## Problem No 1:  
### Write the table of 2 using for loop in python
**Hint:** increment the number by 1 and also in other hand multiply it with 2  
**Formula:** Table_of_2 = (no_start_from_1 +=1) * 2
```python
print("The table of 2")
for i in range(1,11):
    print(f" 2 * {i} = {i*2} ")
```


## Problem No 2:  
### Write the table of 7 using for loop in python
**Hint:** increment the number by 1 and also in other hand multiply it with 7  
**Formula:** Table_of_7 = (no_start_from_1 +=1) * 7
```python
print("The table of 2")
for i in range(1,11):
    print(f" 7 * {i} = {i*7} ")
```


## Problem No 3:  
### Write the table of 11 using for loop in python
**Hint:** increment the number by 1 and also in other hand multiply it with 11  
**Formula:** Table_of_11 = (no_start_from_1 +=1) * 11
```python
print("The table of 11")
for i in range(1,11):
    print(f" 11 * {i} = {i*11} ")
```
